# SPG Assignment

This is a predictive model it seeks to predict the production of a set given certain characteristics.

## [EDA](https://github.com/alexrods/SPG_Assignment/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
- I made a exploratory data analysis to choose data transformation and feature engineering to feed the predictive model.

## [Predictive model](https://github.com/alexrods/SPG_Assignment/blob/main/prediction_model.ipynb)
- Train of a model this model predict the production with a error of 
  
  ***+- 803.20 unities***

    If we consider the dataset **average production as 2000 unities**, we have a error around of *40%* regarding this.
    
## Conclusions

The model has good performance to small productions but when it increases the production the model begins to increase its error, this problem can be solved with a greater amount of data, with a better feature selection or trying with a scaler less susceptible to outliers.
